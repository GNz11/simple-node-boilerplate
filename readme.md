# Simple Node Boilerplate

## Introduction

This boilerplate contains the following:

- express
- sequelize
- sequelize-cli
- nodemon
- eslint
- jest

## Running in Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`
3. `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`
4. `npx nodemon`

## Database Setup

This project uses Sequelize as an ORM. It was set up using the directions here: <https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html>. The easiest way to work with this set up is to use the generator that comes with `sequelize-cli`: <https://github.com/sequelize/cli#usage>.
